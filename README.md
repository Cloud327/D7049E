# Game Idea - Tower Defense
This project is part of the course Virtual interactive environments (course code D7049E), Lule√• University of Technology. The aim of this project is to design a game engine and test it using a game. We have chosen to implement a Tower Defense type game to test our game engine.

# Language - Rust
We have chosen to use Rust when coding our game engine. This is because it offers good speed and memory safety. Since Rust is a pretty new language it also has good documentation and little technical debt. In addition we also felt like this was a good opportunity to learn Rust for the future because of its growing popularity.
